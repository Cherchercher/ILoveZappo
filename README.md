# ILoveZappos
Zappos Intern Application

##Intro:
   ZappoLove is to build an app that takes input from the user as a search query and returns a list of items with the Zappos Rest API.
    Then user can click on a product of their choie and add it to cart with the option to reverse the action. 

##Part II: 
1) Databinding for the product page <br />
2) Animation with SplashScreen and Floating Action Button<br />
3) Following Material Design guidelines<br />
   * floating action button(margins, depth)<br />
   * primary color, accent color<br />
4) Well handled configuration changes<br />
   * onCreate()<br />
   * onClick, onInputChange Listeners<br />
5) Using retrofit to handle REST requests<br />
